## 📣 Announcement

**July 29, 2025!**  

**Please note:** I'm no longer actively developing or maintaining this project as I've gotten too busy with other commitments.  
That said, feel free to explore, fork, and build on it, you're welcome to use it as a base for your own ideas!

This has been a fun side project, and I hope it’s helpful for anyone looking to explore, improve, or contribute to food-related bots. 

On a side note, I will be logging my food recipes [here](https://chefkang.super.site/) feel free to check it out!
